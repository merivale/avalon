# Avalon Game Rules

## Overview

Avalon is a social deduction game where players are divided into two teams: the
**Loyal Servants of Arthur** (Good) and the **Minions of Mordred** (Evil). The
game is played over a series of quests, with Good trying to succeed at quests
and Evil trying to sabotage them.

## Objective

- **Good Team**: Successfully complete **3 out of 5 quests**
- **Evil Team**: Fail **3 out of 5 quests**, or assassinate Merlin after Good
  wins

## Setup

### Team Composition

The number of Evil players depends on the total player count:

| Players | Evil | Good |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| 5       | 2    | 3    |
| 6       | 2    | 4    |
| 7       | 3    | 4    |
| 8       | 3    | 5    |
| 9       | 3    | 6    |
| 10      | 4    | 6    |

### Special Roles

#### Good Team

- **Merlin**: Knows who all Evil players are (except Mordred, if in play)
- **Percival**: Knows who Merlin is (and Morgana, if in play)
- **Loyal Servants of Arthur**: Regular Good players with no special information

#### Evil Team

- **Assassin**: Can attempt to assassinate Merlin at the end if Good wins
- **Mordred**: Hidden from Merlin
- **Morgana**: Appears as Merlin to Percival
- **Oberon**: Unknown to other Evil players and doesn't know them
- **Minions of Mordred**: Regular Evil players who know each other

## Game Flow

### 1. Role Assignment

Each player is secretly and randomly assigned a role and team allegiance.
Players learn their team and any special information their role provides.

### 2. Quest Phase (Repeat for 5 Quests)

#### A. Team Building

1. The **Leader** proposes a team of players to go on the quest
2. The team size is predetermined for each quest (see Quest Requirements)
3. All players see who is proposed
4. Leadership passes clockwise after each proposal (successful or not)

#### B. Team Voting

1. All players simultaneously vote to **approve** or **reject** the proposed
   team
2. If the majority approves, proceed to the Quest
3. If rejected, leadership passes to the next player
4. If **5 consecutive teams are rejected**, the quest fails automatically

#### C. Quest Execution

1. Selected team members secretly vote to **succeed** or **fail** the quest
2. Good players must vote for Success
3. Evil players may vote for Success or Fail
4. The votes are revealed anonymously
5. Quest succeeds if all votes are Success (except Quest 4 with 7+ players,
   which requires 2 Fails to fail)

### 3. Win Conditions

- **Good wins** if 3 quests succeed
  - Then the **Assassin** gets one chance to identify and kill Merlin
  - If successful, Evil wins instead
- **Evil wins** if:
  - 3 quests fail, OR
  - 5 consecutive teams are rejected, OR
  - The Assassin correctly identifies Merlin
